## Yo, I'm a Readme

08/25/2014

Today’s assignment is simple and tailored to help get you used to sharing code, writing some HTML, and creating from scratch. With that, I’d like you to create a JSBin and create a simple site that has 5-10 links and images to sites or applications that inspire you or that you would like to be able to create using your skills after graducation. You should use at least 10 different CSS properties, and feel free to use <p></p> tags to add some comments on your links and images. You will find HTML tags and CSS properties listed on the w3schools links below. When you have completed this, please "close" the issue assigned to on github and add a link to your JSBin.
